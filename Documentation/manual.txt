                                                                       by matesuu

To compile from the src folder, simply type the following line into your terminal interface:

    gcc main.c AUTOGIT.c -o autogit

or alternatively, use the Makefile provided within the src folder and type "make" within the directory.

For macOS and Linux users, there is also a Bash version of autogit within the scripts folder. To run:

    chmod +x autogit.sh


                                                                2. The PATH Variable

In order for autogit to be useful, you must first move the given binary (or script) to your PATH variable. 
This is achieved by the following:

    sudo mv autogit /usr/local/bin

You can now run autogit from any directory.

                                                                3. Commands and Functionality

Here is a comprehensive list of commands and an explanation of their functionality:

help - displays help window
init - initalizes a local git repo and adds a remote repo via a URL ('origin')
remove - removes remote repository within a directory ('origin')
info - displays information regarding remotes ('origin')
new - creates a new branch within remote repo and switches current working branch to target branch
switch - switches the source branch to a given target branch
delete - deletes a branch within the remote repo
push - pushes all changes to a given branch
pull pulls all changes from a given branch

                                                                4. Pushing and Pulling

In order to push to your remote repository, you must first initialize your repository in the parent directory folder by writing
to the terminal the following:

    autogit init <remote_url>

The remote url can be found on the specific repository page hosted on Github/Gitlab. Pushing and pulling can be achieved
through using the commands:

    autogit push <branch_name> <optional: commit message>

    autogit pull <branch_name>
