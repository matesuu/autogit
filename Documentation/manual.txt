                                                                        autogit:
                                                                       a tutorial


                                                                        
                                                                1. Compiling and Running

To compile from the src folder, simply type the following line into your terminal interface:

    gcc main.c AUTOGIT.c -o autogit

or alternatively, use the Makefile provided within the src folder and type "make" within the directory.

For macOS and Linux users, there is also a Bash version of autogit within the scripts folder. To run:

    chmod +x autogit.sh


                                                                2. The PATH Variable

In order for autogit to be useful, you must first move the given binary (or script) to your PATH variable. 
This is achieved by the following:

    sudo mv autogit /usr/local/bin

You can now run autogit from any directory.
